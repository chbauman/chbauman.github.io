# Personal website

Forked from: https://github.com/sujaykundu777/devlopr-jekyll.
Many features were removed for simplicity.

## Local testing

To test the website locally, use:

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

There are more details in a blog post at https://chbauman.github.io/info/2019/11/02/first/.

## TODO's

The following list shows a few tasks that may further improve the website.

- Reduce unused space in Work Exp. and Education
- Fix way to add inline code (\`test` does not work)
- Change color of \<mark>HTML elements\</mark>
- Think of more tasks and implement them
